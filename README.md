# Hand-Safety-Boundary-Detection-System-POC-
This project demonstrates a real-time hand-tracking safety system using only classical computer-vision techniques and a webcam. It detects when the user's hand nears a virtual danger zone and displays clear warnings, serving as a simple POC for safety, gesture alerts, and interactive systems.
