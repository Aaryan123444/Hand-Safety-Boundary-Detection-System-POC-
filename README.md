# Hand-Safety-Boundary-Detection-System-POC-
This project presents a real-time hand-tracking safety system that warns the user when their hand moves close to a predefined virtual danger zone on the screen. It uses a standard webcam and relies entirely on classical computer-vision techniques such as HSV color segmentation, contour detection, and convex-hull–based fingertip estimation. No deep-learning models, MediaPipe, OpenPose, or any external pose-detection frameworks are used. The prototype identifies the user’s fingertip, measures its distance from a virtual boundary, and classifies the interaction into three states: SAFE, WARNING, and DANGER. When the fingertip enters the critical region, the system triggers a clear on-screen alert (“DANGER DANGER”). This lightweight Proof-of-Concept demonstrates how simple but effective computer-vision algorithms can enable human–machine interaction, proximity alerts, and safety-focused interfaces without requiring heavy ML models, making it suitable for academic demonstrations, industrial safety prototypes, and interactive UI experiments.
